<h3><span>    THE CAXTON MEMORIAL AND CHAUCER'S MONUMENT.</span></h3>


 <p class="blockquot">The result of the appeals which have recently been made to the
   sympathies of the present age for the purpose of erecting a
   Memorial to our first Printer, and of restoring the crumbling
   tomb of one of our earliest and greatest Poets, has gone near to
   prove that the admirers of Caxton and Chaucer are disposed to
   yield to the objects of their hero-worship little more than lip
   service. In short, the plan for the Caxton Memorial, and that for
   the restoration of Chaucer's Monument, have well nigh failed.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">The projectors of the former had, indeed, in the necessity of
   settling what the Caxton Memorial should be, to encounter, at the
   very outset of their undertaking, one difficulty from which the
   Chaucer Committee was free; and the uncertainty whether it should
   assume the form of the symbolical "lamp and fountain" so
   poetically suggested by the Dean of St. Paul's, or the ideal
   cast-iron statue of the Coalbrook Dale Company, may have had a
   sinister effect upon the Subscription List.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> Between the suggestive symbol and the fancy portrait there would
   seem to be little room for hesitation, since the former would
   merely veil a truth, while the latter would perpetuate a
   falsehood. But our readers have had before them a third, and, as
   it seems to us, a far more reasonable proposal, in that made by
   M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> for a collective impression of Caxton's
   original compositions: and we cannot but think that if that
   gentleman will take the trouble to enter into the necessary
   details as to the extent of such compositions, and the expense of
   transcribing and printing them, his scheme may yet be realised,
   and that too to the satisfaction of all the subscribers to the
   Caxton Memorial. The following communication indicates the favour
   with which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY'S</span> proposal will probably be received by the
   followers of Caxton's art in this country.</p>

<p>I have just read with great pleasure the article on "A Caxton Memorial
suggested" in your Number for the 19th of July. I was particularly
pleased with the "<i>proposed conditions</i>;" and as an humble follower of
the art of which Caxton stands at the head, and as an enthusiastic
admirer of that great and talented, and learned printer, I should feel
great pleasure in becoming a subscriber, should anything of the kind be
undertaken; and have no doubt but that many,&mdash;aye, as many as might be
required to complete the subscription list, might be found among the
printers of this
<a id="this146"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[146]</span>
country, who would feel proud to subscribe to
such a "Memorial." If anything of the kind should be undertaken, the
projectors might depend upon me becoming a subscriber.</p>

 <p class="right">    H<span class="smcap lowercase">ENRY</span> R<span class="smcap lowercase">YLETT</span>, Printer.</p>

 <p class="left">  Horncastle, Aug. 18. 1851.</p>



  <p class="blockquot"> The following letter, on the other hand, from a correspondent
   whose smallest suggestion deserves, as it will be sure to
   receive, the respectful attention of all who have the pleasure of
   knowing his high personal character and great acquirements,
   although pointing at what might be a fitting Memorial of one of
   the greatest of the Worthies of Westminster, clearly indicates
   that if M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY'S</span> scheme can be carried out it will have the
   benefit of the writer's encouragement and support:</p>


<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY'S</span> letter is entitled to much attention. It is
satisfactory to learn that the original design has been abandoned. The
fountain and the illumination might be a very pretty idea, but it would
have sorely puzzled some of our countrymen to connect that memorial in
their minds with the name and services of the first English printer.</p>

<p>Might not the funds that were raised be advantageously employed in
founding a Caxton scholarship at Westminster School; or in the building
or enlarging some school bearing Caxton's name, connected with
Westminster? The spiritual wants of that city are great.</p>

<p>If the statue be raised, which should not present a <i>bonâ fide</i>
resemblance to our celebrated printer, it would be worse than
valueless&mdash;something like an imposture and it would have as little
connexion with Caxton as the statue in St. Peter's bears to the great
Apostle, though called by his name.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY'S</span> proposal, of giving an impression of Caxton's original
compositions, would unquestionably be his most enduring and glorious
monument. These reprints would be dear, not only to the bibliographer,
but to the philologist and men of letters generally. But the work would
be an expensive one, and the editors should be far more liberally
recompensed than by merely receiving a limited number of copies. As the
subscription would probably be very limited, the work should be
undertaken by the nation, and not by individuals; still, the funds
already raised, if not otherwise expended for educational purposes, as
before suggested, would serve as the foundation for accomplishing
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY'S</span> excellent suggestion.</p>


  <p class="right">  J. H. M.</p>


<p class="blockquot">   Our present purpose, however, is to call attention to a hint
   thrown out not only in the following Note addressed to ourselves
   (which, be it observed, has been in type for several weeks), but
   also in the pages of our learned and able contemporary the
   G<span class="smcap lowercase">ENTLEMAN'S</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">AGAZINE</span>, in an article from which we extract the
   most important passage, namely, that in the event of the failure
   of the projected Caxton Memorial, the funds subscribed might with
   propriety and good effect be applied (the consent of the
   subscribers being of course first obtained) to an object with
   which Caxton himself would so surely have sympathised, namely,
   the restoration of the tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer:</p>


<p><i>Chaucer and Caxton.</i>&mdash;"Not half" of the required 100<i>l.</i> "has yet been
subscribed" for the restoration of Chaucer's monument. Chaucer was an
especial favourite of Caxton; and as the first English printer seems for
awhile destined to remain without "light and fountain," as once upon a
time suggested by Dr. Milman, treasurer of the Caxton fund, possibly the
subscribers to that fund would not object to the transmission of the sum
required by the old monument of the poet, from the no monument of the
printer? Will the Dean of St. Paul's ask for suffrages on the matter?</p>

 <p class="right"> Q.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> After alluding to the various proposals for the Caxton Memorial,
   and the correspondence between
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span> and
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ERIAH</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">OTFIELD</span> in
 "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," Sylvanus Urban proceeds:
</p>

<p>"But the discussion will do good. If neither proposal can be carried
out, we shall probably have a better suggestion than either. The money
in hand is said to be <i>far short</i> of the sum necessary to erect a statue
or to print the works; if so, why not repair Chaucer's tomb with it?
Nothing would be more agreeable to Caxton himself. He not only printed
Chaucer's works, and re-imprinted them merely to get rid of errors; but,
feeling that the great poet 'ought eternally to be remembered' in the
place where he lies buried, he hung up an epitaph to his memory over
that tomb which is now mouldering to decay.</p>

   <div class="poem">
<p>   "'Post obitum Caxton voluit te vivere, cura</p>
        <p class="i3">Willelmi, Chaucer clare poeta, tui,</p>
      <p>Nam tua, non solum, compressit opuscula formis,</p>
        <p class="i3">Has quoque sed laudes jussit hic esse tuas.'</p>
</div>

<p>"The epitaph, touching evidence of Caxton's affection for the poet, has
disappeared. In a few years the tomb itself will have submitted to
inevitable fate. What better mode of keeping alive the memory of both
Chaucer and Caxton, or of doing honour to the pious printer, than by
showing that even after the lapse of centuries his wishes for the
preservation of Chaucer's memory in that place are not forgotten? If the
fund is more than sufficient for the purpose, the surplus might be
invested on trust to perform the wish of Caxton, by keeping Chaucer's
monument in repair for ever."&mdash;<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, August, p. 167.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> Here we leave the matter for the present not, however, without
   the hope that the present age will do
<a id="do147"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[147]</span>
 honour to the
   memories of two of our Illustrious Dead, and that few months will
   witness both a Caxton Memorial in the shape of a collective
   edition of his original writings, and the Restoration of the
   Monument of the Father of English Poetry.</p>




<h2><span class="bla">Notes.</span></h2>


<h3><span>COLLAR OF SS.<br />
(Vol. ii., pp. 89. 475.)</span></h3>

<p>No less than nine long months have elapsed since you adopted my
suggestion of limiting your columns, on the disputed question relative
to the collar of SS., to a record of the names of those persons who,
either on the monumental effigies or brasses, or in their portraits or
otherwise, are represented as wearing that ornament; together with a
short statement of the position held by each of these individuals in the
court of the then reigning monarch, seeming to warrant the assumption.
How is it that the invitation has not produced more than a single
response? Is it that the combatants are more fond of discussing the
probabilities of a disputed point, than of seeking for facts to aid in
its illustration? I hope that this is not so, in an age that prides
itself in its antiquarian and historical investigations; and I trust
that, now the dismissal of the parliament has relieved many from onerous
duties, your pages may benefit, not only on this but on other important
subjects, by the vacational leisure of your learned contributors.</p>

<p>That I may not myself be chargeable with a continuance of the silence of
which I complain, I now offer to you no less than eleven of the earliest
names, principally taken from Boutell's <i>Monumental Brasses</i>, but some
suggested in your own pages, on whose monuments or otherwise the collar
occurs. To most of these I have added a few particulars seeming to
warrant the assumption; and I doubt not that some of your correspondents
will supply you with similar hints as to those of whom I have as yet
been unable to trace anything applicable to the subject of enquiry.</p>

<p>1. The first of these is in 1382, seventeen years before the accession
of Henry IV. It appears on the brass of Sir Thomas Burton, in Little
Castreton Church, in Rutlandshire. This knight, we find, received
letters of protection on accompanying the Duke of Lancaster to France in
1369, when Edward III. revived his claim to that kingdom.
<a id="kingdom1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Being thus
one of the retainers of the duke, the assumption of his collar of livery
may be at once accounted for.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#kingdom1" class="label">[1]</a> N. F&oelig;dera, iii. 870.</p>

<p>2. The next that we have is on the monument of John Gower in the church
of St. Saviour, Southwark. The poet died in 1402, 4 Henry IV. It is more
than doubtful whether he was a knight, and the only ground that I can
suggest for his being represented with the collar of SS. is, that he was
in some manner, perhaps as the court poet, attached to the household of
the king. Of his transferred devotion to Henry IV. we have sufficient
evidence in the revision of his <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, from which he
excluded all that he had previously said in praise of his patron Richard
II.</p>

<p>3. Sir Thomas Massingberd died in 1406, and on his monument in Gunby
Church in Lincolnshire, both he and his lady are represented with
collars of SS. Why, I have still to seek.</p>

<p>4. In 1407 there is a similar instance of a knight and his lady being so
ornamented. These are Sir William and Lady Bagot, whose monument is in
Baginton Chruch, Warwickshire. Boutell says that he was the first who
received this decoration from the king. Be this as it may, the Patent
Rolls contain sufficient to account for his and his wife's assuming King
Henry's livery from gratitude for the restoration of his land, which he
had forfeited as an adherent to Richard II.

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Richard2" class="label">[2]</a> Cal. Rot. Pat. 236. 243.</p>

<p>5. Then follows Sir John Drayton, whose monument, dated in 1411, is in
Dorchester Church, Oxfordshire. It may be presumed that he was in the
king's household; as in the beginning of the reign of Richard II. he was
keeper of the royal swans; and early in that of Henry IV., was serjeant
of the king's pavilions and tents. Thomas Drayton, who was made Assayer
of the Mint in the year of Sir John's death,
<a id="death3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 was probably his son.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#death3" class="label">[3]</a> Cal. Rot. Pat. 196. 259.; Devon's Issue Roll, 286.</p>

<p>6. In the following year, 1412, we have the collar of SS. represented on
the brass of Sir Thomas Swynborne in Little Horkeley Church, Essex. Two
or three years before, and perhaps at the time of his death, the knight
held the offices of Mayor of Bordeaux, and of the king's lieutenant in
those parts.</p>

<p>The last five of these are in the reign of Henry IV. In the reign of
Henry V., I am not aware of any examples; but in that of Henry VI., we
find five other instances.</p>

<p>7. In Trotton Church, Sussex, is the monument of Thomas Lord Camoys, who
died in 1424, and of his wife; both of whom are distinguished by the
collar. He was a Knight of the Garter, and commanded the left wing of
the English army at the battle of Agincourt.</p>

<p>8. A monument, supposed to be that of Sir John Segrave, dated in 1425,
occurs in Dorchester Church, Oxfordshire: of whom I can state nothing.</p>

<p>9. On the brass of John Leventhorpe, Esq., in the church of
Sawbridgeworth, in Hertfordshire,
<a id="Hertf148"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[148]</span>
 the collar is also to be
found. He died in 1433, and was one of the executors named in the will
of King Henry IV.
<a id="Henry4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> </p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Henry4" class="label">[4]</a> Devon's Issue Roll, 334.</p>

<p>10. The monument in Yatton Church, Somersetshire, representing a judge
in his robes, is traditionally ascribed to Sir Richard Newton, who died
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1449. This is, I believe, the first
example of a judge being represented with the collar of SS.</p>

<p>11. The silver collars of the king's livery bequeathed by the will of
John Baret of Bury, may be presumed, although he did not die till after
the accession of Edward IV., to be of the livery of Henry VI.; as he is
not only represented on his tomb, which he had erected during Henry's
reign, with the collar of SS.; but the chantry, also built by him, is
profusely ornamented with the same collar, enclosing his monogram J. B.
He probably received the privilege of wearing it during Henry's visit to
St. Edmondsbury in 1433.

<p>I shall be glad to see a continuation of this list carried on through
subsequent reigns, since it is only by the multiplication of examples
that we shall be enabled to form a more correct conclusion on the
various questions connected with this interesting subject.</p>

<p>Will one of your correspondents kindly inform me where it appears that
Richard II. ever wore the collar of SS.?</p>

<h3><span>PRINTING.</span></h3>

<p>This art cannot be assigned to any single year, but must rather be
referred to a <i>decennium</i>; and the one in which we now are (1851&mdash;1860),
is certainly the first decennium of the fifth century of the existence
of the art. If anything were proposed in the way of celebration of this
<i>anni</i>versary, probably the year 1855 would be chosen, not only as the
year which touches the middle of the decennium, but as being very
probably the year in which the printing of the Bible was completed. We
have then a year or two to consider in what manner the spirit which
anniversaries usually call up shall be turned to account. The following
will probably be suggested.</p>

<p><i>A feed.</i> If we could call down Fust and Gutenberg to witness that
within twelve hours after dessert and commonplaces are finished, an
account of the dinner, as long as three epistles of St. Paul, would be
about the world in something like a hundred thousand copies, such a
celebration would have a strong point of interest about it.</p>

<p><i>A monument in sculpture.</i> That is to say, a lame subscription, a
committee, five-and-twenty abusive paragraphs before the thing is done,
one more when, ten years after, it is completed, and a short notice in
the handbooks of London in all time to come.</p>

<p>If these two modes are abandoned, many others would be proposed. Mine
would be, a subscription to defray the expense of publishing, on a large
scale, a book of fac-similes of early typography, to be sold at a cheap
rate, with such prefatory matter as would form an accurate popular
history of printing from 1450 to 1550. The great interest with which I
saw plain working men looking at the treasures now exhibited in glass
cases at the British Museum, made me think of this.</p>

<p>Reference is frequently made upon the origin of printing, to the
<i>fasciculus temporum</i>, or <i>Cologne Chronicle</i>. In one place I find a
citation in support of the Gutenberg Bible having been commenced in
1450; in another citation it is only affirmed that printing was first
done in that year. The only edition I have the means of consulting at
this moment is that of Ratdolt, 1484. And here I find nothing about
printing except that, of the year 1457 and thereabouts, it is said that</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Artifices mira celeritate subtiliores solito fiunt. Et
   impressores librorum multiplicant in terra."</p>

<p>In the preface Ratdolt says that he had printed the <i>fasciculus</i> three
times already, of which Hain mentions two. He says, moreover, that this
fourth (Venice) edition was <i>cura et opera diligentiori</i>. Did Ratdolt,
after inquiry, abandon the more specific account above cited, and
content himself with the above sentence, as expressing all that could be
verified; or, as I have sometimes supposed, do <i>different books</i>
circulate under the title of <i>fasciculus temporum</i>? Be this as it may,
Ratdolt expressly refers to the great impulse which the mechanical arts
in general received just about the time when printing became common. Now
we may hope the same thing of the decennium on which we are entering,
the beginning of which is made conspicuous by the great forcing-house of
art, which has not yet got the name it is to keep.</p>

stick a pin will be the luck (good or bad) that attends them the

<h4><span ><i>Mode of Discovering the Bodies of the Drowned.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;What must we think of
the following, transcribed from the <i>Gentleman's Mag.</i>, vol. xxxvii. p.
189.? Can such things be?</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"W<span class="smcap lowercase">EDNESDAY</span>, A<span class="smcap lowercase">PRIL</span> 8, 1767.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"An inquisition was taken at <i>Newbery</i>, <i>Berks</i>, on the body of a
   child near two years old, who fell into the river <i>Kennet</i>, and
   was drowned. The jury brought in their verdict <i>accidental
   death</i>. The body was discovered
<a id="disco149"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[149]</span>
by a very singular
   experiment, which was as follows:&mdash;After diligent search had been
   made in the river for the child, to no purpose, a two-penny loaf,
   with a quantity of quicksilver put into it, was set floating from
   the place where the child it was supposed had fallen in, which
   steered its course down the river upwards of half a mile, before
   a great number of spectators, when the body happening to lay on
   the contrary side of the river, the loaf suddenly tacked about,
   and swam across the river, and gradually sunk near the child,
   when both the child and loaf were immediately brought up, with
   grabbers ready for that purpose."</p>

<p>Is this experiment ever tried at the present time, and do there exist
any authentic accounts of such trials and their results?</p>

<p><i>Somersetshire Rhyme.</i>&mdash;In Vol. iii., p. 206., there is mention of a
traditional rhyme on Lynn and Rising. At Taunton, in Somersetshire,
there is a similar tradition current:</p>

     <div class="poem"><p> "Nertown was a market town</p>
     <p> When Taunton was a furzy down."</p></div>

<p>This Nertown is a village adjoining Taunton, and lying on the north side
of it. Its name is variously regarded as a corruption of Northtown
Near-town, and Nethertown, of which the last is doubtless the right
derivation.</p>

<h3><span>DICTIONARY OF HACKNEYED QUOTATIONS.</span></h3>

<p>Allow me to suggest the publication of a small work, which might be
entitled "The Book of Hackneyed Quotations." Manifold would be its
usefulness. Here information would be imparted to enquirers anxious to
discover the source of such passages and the labours of other oracles,
as well as of the editor of "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>," would be thus in this
department diminished. Reporters would by this means be enabled to
correct mistakes; for, owing either to blunders in the delivery, or
errors in the short-hand notes, rarely are quotations faithfully
printed. The gentleman "totally unaccustomed to public speaking," and
the orator of "unadorned eloquence," might from hence cull some flowers
wherewith to embellish their speeches while to the practised author and
the accomplished speaker such a collection might serve as an index
expurgatorius, teaching them what to avoid as common-place, and so the
recurrence of old friends, "familiar in our mouths as household words,"
would be more "like angels' visits, few and far between."</p>

<p>An index referring to the rhyming or important words should be appended,
and it would be advisable to subjoin translation of the few Latin and
French citations.</p>

<p>Surely it is "devoutly to be wished" that the proposed little work may
find "a local habitation and a name," and that the idea may not vanish
into thin air "like the baseless fabric of a vision." No doubt several
of your correspondents who do not think that "ignorance is bliss," and
that it is "folly to be wise," would gladly lend their aid, and the
constant "cry" would be "they come." As to the title, "a rose by any
other name would smell as sweet:" but "somewhat too much of this."</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Notes.</span></h3>

<h4><span><i>Cocker's Arithmetic.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have a copy of Cocker's <i>Arithmetic</i>, the 37th
edition, 1720, with an engraved portrait of the author; respecting which
there is the following manuscript note on the flyleaf:&mdash;</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"Mr. Douce, of Bath, the literary antiquary and book-collector,
   showed me a copy of Cocker's <i>Arithmetic</i>, with the <i>frontispiece
   cut of the author</i>, which he said was very scarce.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "J. P., April, 1823."</p>

<p>Mr. Douce's copy (the first edition, 1678) is now in the possession of

for it.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Duke of Normandy.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The question relative to the late Duke of
Normandy being the individual who was Dauphin of France, the son of
Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette, and who was said to have died in the
Temple, has never been as publicly and satisfactorily settled as it
deserves. The high station and unquestionable integrity of the
individuals of the Perceval family who instituted the inquiry, and in
the most open manner laid the results of that inquiry before the public,
constitute an unexceptionable guarantee for its genuineness and
authenticity. The acute perception and accurate memory of Madame Tussaud
carry great weight with them. She was asked by the writer of this
paragraph, if she thought the person calling himself the Duke of
Normandy was the same individual she had modelled when a child. Madame
Tussaud replied with great emphasis, "I would take my oath of it for he
had a peculiar formation on the neck which still remains. Besides
something transpired between us, which he referred to, which was never
likely to be mentioned to any one." The late Mr. Jeremy, the active and
highly intelligent magistrate who presided in the court of Greenwich,
and whose long experience adds value to his judgment, was of opinion
that there were no traces of the impostor discovered by him during
several scrutinising examinations which were held in his office, and
that the members of the old French nobility who were present treated him
with profound respect. He was supported through unknown channels, was
twice shot at, and refused permission by the French government, though
it was applied for by legal advocates of the highest standing, to bring
the question before the legal
<a id="legal150"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[150]</span>
 tribunals. At first the Emperor of
Russia and the King of Prussia, who knew that the Dauphin was alive,
opposed the Duke of Wellington's proposal to reinstate Louis XVIII. The
Empress Josephine is also said to have been aware, that the Dauphine did
not die in the Temple, and is reported to have said "Ah! legitimacy is
nearer than you suppose." It is an unsettled historical question worthy
the attention of the historian who has time to bestow on it.</p>

 <p class="right"> Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span>.</p>


<h4><span><i>Anachronisms and Errors of Painters.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Perhaps the commonest of all
anachronisms of painters is that of representing St. John Baptist in a
Holy Family, himself a child, adoring the infant Saviour, and carrying a
slight cross or flag, with the motto "Ecce Agnus Dei." That John knew
our Lord as an eminently holy man is clear frown his expostulation, "I
have need to be baptized of Thee," &amp;c.; but he himself most distinctly
assures us that it was not till he saw the Spirit descending on Jesus
like a dove that he knew him as the promised Messiah and Lamb of God.</p>

<p>I have seen an engraving from an old Master (perhaps some of your
correspondents may remember the painting itself) in which the mother of
Zebedee's children comes forward to beg the boon on their behalf, James
and John being represented as boys of seven or eight, one on each side
of her. These errors of painters are perhaps excusable when they
occurred at a time when the Bible was not in everybody's hands: but what
excuse can we make for artist's blunders now? The <i>Illustrated News</i> has
lately given us prints from paintings by living artists, in one of
which, "Noah's Sacrifice," a couple of fat ducks figure as <i>clean</i> fowl
at the foot of the altar; and in the other, the Five Wise and Five
Foolish Virgins have increased into two sevens; neither error being
apparently noticed by the editor. It is said that no sea piece, however
fine, is admitted to our exhibitions if the rigging is incorrect. Would
it not be quite as advisable to exclude Scripture pieces with palpable
blunders?</p>

   <p class="right">  P. P.</p>


<h4><span><i>The Ring Finger.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The English Book of Common Prayer orders that the
ring should be put "upon the <i>fourth</i> finger of the woman's left hand;"
and the spousal manuals of York and Salisbury assign this practical
reason for the selection of the said finger:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Quia in illo digito est quædam vena procedens usque ad
   cor."&mdash;Maskell, <i>Ancient Liturgy of the Church of England</i>, 2nd
   edition, Preface, page clv. note: Lond. 1846.</p>


<p>Aulus Gellius tells us&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Veteres Græcos annulum habuisse in digito accepimus sinistræ
   manus, qui minimo est proximus. Romanos quoque homines aiunt, sic
   plerumque annulis usitatos. Causam esse hujus rei Appianus in
   libris Ægyptiacis hanc dicit: quod insectis apertisque humanis
   corporibus, ut mos in Ægypto fuit, quas
Graeci <span title="[Greek: anatomas]">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#956;&#8048;&#962;</span>
  appellant, repertum est, <i>nervum quendam tenuissimum ab eo uno
   digito, de quo diximus, ad cor hominis pergere ac pervenire</i>.
   Propterea non inscitum visum esse, eum potissimum digitum tali
   honore decorandum, qui continens et quasi connexus esse cum
   principatu cordis videretur."&mdash;<i>Noctes Atticæ</i>, lib. x. cap. 10.</p>

<p>Other reasons are assigned by Macrobius; and the author of the <i>Vulgar
Errors</i> (book iv. ch. 4.) has entirely overthrown the anatomical fiction
mentioned above. Can any one give me any further information than that
contained in L'Estrange or Wheatly, or in the authors to which they
refer? The fourth finger of the left hand is certainly "the least active
finger of the hand least used, upon which, therefore, the ring may be
always in view, and least subject to be worn out:" but this is a very
unromantic and utilitarian idea.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Od Force.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;As considerable interest appertains to the earlier
manifestations of what is now termed Mesmerism, the following Note may
not be altogether unworthy of a place.</p>

<p>The experiment, upon which a subjective proof of the agency of the power
of Od is founded, as described by Dr. Herbert Mayo in the supplementary
chapter to the last edition of <i>Letters on the Truths contained in
Popular Superstitions</i>, and alluded to by R. D. H. (Vol. iii., p. 517.),
is another instance of there being "nothing new under the sun." In the
<i>Bigarrures du Seigneur des Accords</i>, first published at Paris in 1582,
in the chapter "Des faux Sorciers et de leur Impostures" occurs the
following passage, which I copy <i>verbatim et literatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Autres ont une ruse, qu'ils semblent d'attacher un anneau d'or
   ou d'argent à un petit filet, qu'on suspend dans un verre à demy

   bellement ce verset du Psalme, autant de fois, 'Ecce enim

agitation regarding costume now going on in America, is not entirely
novel; the Turkish fashion having been introduced unsuccessfully into
this metropolis in the last century:&mdash;</p>

<h2><span class="bla">Queries.</span></h2>


<h3><span>JUDGES STYLED REVEREND, ETC.</span></h3>

<p>I read a Query not long ago as to the time when the title "Very
Reverend" was first given to Deans. I would also offer a Query, When did
the Judges lose the title of "Reverend" and "Very Reverend," and obtain
that of "Honorable?" In the second volume of <i>The Year Books</i> the
approbation of the twelve judges to the publication of the reports is
headed, "By the approbation of the <i>Reverend Judges</i>;" and the following
is copied from the title-page: "<i>Le Premier Part de les Reports del
Cases en Ley, que furent argués en le Temps de le très Haut et Puissant
Prince, Roy Edward le Tierce. Ore nouvelment Imprimés, Corrigés et
Amendés, avec les Notations and References de l' très Reverend et trés
Sage Juges de cest Royaulme, Brook et Fitzherbert. Printed, 1679.</i>"</p>

<p>In the title-page of the sixth volume we find "<i>Avec les Notations de le
très Reverend Juges, Brook et Fitzherbert</i>."</p>

<p>Was this title, "Reverend," derived from the address given to judges
when ecclesiastics filled judicial offices, or is it simply a title of
respect applied to all persons to whom, on account of their position in
society, respectful address is due; of which we have an example in
Othello's address to the Venetian senators:</p>


    <div class="poem">
 <p> "Most potent, grave, and reverend seniors."</p>
</div>

<p>When did the address, "The Honorable," now given to the judges, come
into use?</p>

<p>How comes it that in Court the Puisne Judges are addressed by the title
of "Lord," whereas the Master of the Rolls, who ranks before them,
receives the title of "Your Honor?"</p>

<p>The use of the title "Honorable" to the House of Commons, and to members
within its walls, is familiar to us all.</p>

<p>The worthiness and antiquity of the title is proved by its being given
to one of the Persons of the Eternal Trinity in the Te Deum.</p>

<h3><span class="bla">Minor Queries.</span></h3>


<h4><span>93. <i>Frederick Egmont; Peter (Egmont?).</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;They appear as booksellers
merely and only, so far as I can make out, because the <i>promptorius
puerorum</i>, or <i>medulla grammaticæ</i>, printed by Pynson, in 1499, is said,
in the colophon, to be at their expense. Neither Ames nor Dibdin gives
any further evidence. The following is therefore worth a Note. It is
from the <i>ad lectorem</i> (or rather, the <i>adolescentibus studiosis</i>) of
the <i>Multorum Vocabulorum equivocorum interpretatio Magistri Johannes de
garlandia</i>: Paris, 1502, 4to.</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "Sed nihil tam arduum tamque difficile fuit quod labor improbus

   amantissimus, nullum unque librum ex officina sua nisi perquam

<p>Query, was F. Egmont a printer as well as a bookseller? Granting that
<i>officina</i> means a shop, how can a mere bookseller sell none but
correctly printed works? The writer of the above was himself a
bookseller (Joh. Ant. Venetus).</p>

<p>Of Peter above-mentioned, or rather of his name, the following is the
history:&mdash;The colophon of the <i>promptorius</i>, of which there is a copy in
the Grenville Library, runs as follows "... in expensis virtuosorum
virorum Frederici Egmont et Petri post pascha, anno domini <span class="smcap lowercase">MCCCC</span>
nonagessimo nono, decima v'a die mensis Maii." Hence Hain and others
have entered Peter post Pascha as an English bookseller, presuming that
the words <i>post pascha</i> cannot belong to the date, because the more
definite day, "May 15," follows. But surely, among the varieties of the
time when every man did what seemed good in his own eyes as to titles,
colophons, &amp;c., it may easily have happened that a double description of
a part of the date may have occurred, one description containing more
than the other. Query, Can any other instance be produced of this
hypertautology?
<a id="hyper6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
At any rate, such a thing is more likely than that a
bookseller should have been called <i>Peter After-Easter</i>. At the same
time such whimsical things were done in the Latinization of names, both
by their owners and by others for them, that no certain conclusion can
be drawn. For example, more atrocious changes have been made than would
be that of Easterby into <i>post pascha</i>.</p>

<h4><span>94. <i>Unlucky for pregnant Women to take an Oath.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In a police case,
reported in <i>The Times</i> of the 28th of May, a woman was called as a
witness who, however, upon the book being tendered to her, positively
refused to be sworn, with the remark, that it must be evident to the
magistrate that she could not take an oath. The usher of the court said
that the woman was pregnant, and that low women who were in that
situation, entertained an absurd belief that it was unlucky to take an
oath. What is the origin of this superstition? Is it common amongst the
uneducated classes of society?</p>

Faulkner, in his <i>History of Chelsea</i>, observes that he was probably a
native of Devonshire; but there appears to be some ground for
considering that he was of a family settled at Mayroyd, in the parish of
Halifax in Yorkshire. In a conveyance of the estate, dated 29th January,
1581, the grantor is Matthew Sutcliffe, "Doctor of Civil Law, dwelling
in London." He was of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Doctor of Civil
Law: he died in 1629. In his will he desires to be buried in Exeter
Cathedral. Probably the inscription on his tombstone, if still existing,
might settle this uncertainty. I shall feel obliged to any of your

<p>&mdash;I have two old quarto tracts, of eight pages

one of them, between 1520 and 1530, or thereabouts. They are part of a
satirical controversy, the subject of which is very obscure, between
<i>Nemo</i> of Wittemberg, and <i>Nullus</i> of Leipsic. Though printed, we must
suppose, at the two places, the opponents have evidently clubbed for a
woodcut to be common to the two title-pages.</p>

<p>In this cut an unfortunate householder stands in an attitude of despair,
surrounded by what are as much in our day as in his the doings of

is visible, in which two nobodies are busy with his meat and wine. A
young woman is carrying an infant to the priest to be baptized; and from
the way in which the worthy man holds up his finger, we may fear she has
just confessed that it is nobody's child. Can any of your readers give

British king on the one hand, and an innkeeper of Bithynia on the other.
In favour of the former, we have Geoffrey of Monmouth, Carte the English
historian, and modern Welsh authors; for the latter, Gibbon and his
authorities. The object of the present Query is threefold: 1. Will some
one having access to Geoffrey be kind enough to favour me (in the
original or a translation) with the exact statement of the chronicler to
which Gibbon refers? 2. Are writers of intelligence and credit quite
agreed that the tradition which assigns to the wife of Constantius a
royal British parentage was "invented in the darkness of monasteries?"
3. Where is the question&mdash;one of interest in many ways&mdash;fully and
satisfactorily discussed?</p>


 <p class="right">  H.</p>



  <p class="blockquot"> [The statement will be found in Geoffrey's <i>British History</i>,

   married the daughter of Coel,
<a id="Coel7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7." href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
 whose name was Helena. She
   surpassed all the ladies of the country in beauty, as she did all
   others of the time in her skill in music and the liberal arts.
   Her father had no other issue to succeed him on the throne; for
   which reason he was very careful about her education, that she
   might be better qualified to govern the kingdom. Constantius,
   therefore, having made her partner of his bed, had a son by her
   called Constantine." Thus far Geoffrey; and with him agree
   Baronius, Ussher, Stillingfleet, and Camden. The learned Lipsius'
   opinion of this tradition, in his letter to Mr. Camden, will be
   found in his <i>Epistles</i>, page 64. The traditions, however, is not
   mentioned by Gildas, Nennius, or Bede. Our correspondent will

<p>I have delayed contradicting the stories told about the Royal Library in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>
<a id="view155"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[155]</span>
 of last December, and repeated in the
<i>Illustrated Boswell</i>, and, I am sorry to say, still more gravely and

delayed, I say, until I was enabled to satisfy myself more completely as
to one of the allegations of <i>your</i> Note. I can now venture to assure
you that the whole story of the projected sale to Russia is absolutely
unfounded; and that the Princess Lieven, whose supposed agency is the
gist of the story, never heard a syllable about it, till my inquiry
brought it to her notice, and that she has given it the most absolute
contradiction. As there never was any such proposition, I need not say
that the interference against it attributed to Mr. Heber and Lord
Sidmouth is equally unfounded. The real history of the affair is
this:&mdash;Mr. Nash, the architect, had rendered himself very agreeable to
George IV. by his alterations and additions to the Pavilion at Brighton,
and he managed to obtain (somewhat irregularly, I believe) the job of
altering old Buckingham House, which was originally intended, or at
least proposed, to be only an extensive repair and more commodious
arrangement of the existing edifice. Under that notion, Mr. Nash had
little difficulty in persuading the king that the space occupied by so
large a library could not be spared for that purpose, if the house was
to be arranged as a <i>palace</i> both for private residence and for purposes
of state; and as there was a very great jealousy in Parliament of the
expense of Buckingham House, he was afraid to propose the erection of an
additional building to receive the books. It was then that the scheme
was hit on, I know not exactly by whom (but I believe by Mr. Nash), of
giving the books to the British Museum. The principal part of the
library occupied three large rooms, two oblong and one an octagon. The
former were to have been absorbed into the living apartments, and the
octagon was to be preserved as a <i>chapel</i>, which it was proposed to
adorn with the seven <i>cartoons</i> of Raphael from Hampton Court. All
these, and several other schemes, vanished before Mr. Nash's larger
views and increased favour, which led by degrees to the total
destruction of the old house, and the erection of an entirely new
palace, which however retains strong evidence of the occasional and
piecemeal principle on which it was begun. But in the meanwhile the
library was gone. <i>I know</i> that some members of the government were very
averse to this disposal of the library: they thought, and <i>strongly
represented</i>, that a royal residence should, not be without a library;
and that this particular collection, made especially <i>ad hoc</i>, should
not have been, on any pretence, and above all on one so occasional and
trivial, diverted from its original destination. It is very possible
that Mr. Heber may have expressed this opinion; and I think I may say
that Lord Sidmouth certainly did so: but, on the other hand, some of the
king's advisers were not sorry to see the collection added to the Museum
<i>pro bono publico</i>; and so the affair concluded,&mdash;very unsatisfactorily,
as I thought and think, as regards the crown, to whom this library ought
to have been an heirloom; and indeed I doubt whether it was not so in
point of law. It is likely enough that the gift of the library may have
been <i>partly</i> prompted by a hope of putting the public in better humour
as to the expenses of Buckingham House; but the idea of a <i>sale to
Russia</i> never, I am sure, entered the head of any of the parties.</p>

<h3><span>THE "EISELL" CONTROVERSY.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 64. 135.)</span></h3>

<p>I can easily suppose, after the space you have given to J. S. W. (Vol.
iv., p. 64.) to sum up on the long-protracted controversy of the
<i>Eisell</i> interpretation, that you will scarcely permit it to be renewed.
J. S. W.'s judgment, though given with much amenity and fulness, I
cannot think satisfactory, as towards its close he evidently sinks into
the advocate.</p>

<p>Theobald, a most admirable annotator, has narrowed the controversy very
properly, to the consideration whether Hamlet was here proposing
possibilities or impossibilities. J. S. W. dwells on the whole of the
dialogue between Hamlet and Laertes as a rant; and sinks all the lines
and passages that would bring it down to sanity. But this seems to line
singularly unjust. Imprimis, Hamlet is not enraged like Laertes, "who
hath a dear sister lost," and is a very choleric, impetuous, and
arrogant young gentleman. It is this quality which irritates Hamlet, who
is otherwise in the whole of this scene in a particularly moralising and
philosophic mood, and is by no means "splenetic and rash." Hamlet, a
prince, is openly cursed by Laertes: he is even seized by him, and he
still only remonstrates. There is anything but rant in what he (Hamlet)
says; he uses the most homely phrases; so homely that there is something
very like scorn in them:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>  &mdash;&mdash; "What wilt thou <i>do</i> for her?"</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent">is the quietude of contempt for Laertes' insulting rant; and so, if my
memory deceive me not, the elder Kean gave it; "<i>Do</i> for her" being put
in contrast with Laertes' braggadocio <i>say</i>. Then come the
possibilities:</p>


   <div class="poem">
 <p> "Woul't weep, fight, fast, tear thyself,"</p>
</div>

<p>(All, be it noted, common lover's tricks),</p>


    <div class="poem">
<p> "Would drink up eisell, eat a crocodile,</p>
    <p>  I'll do't."</p>
</div>

<p>Now the eating a crocodile is the real difficulty, for that looks like
an impossibility but then, no doubt, the crocodile, like all other
monstrous things, was in the pharmacop&oelig;ia of the time, and
<a id="and156"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[156]</span>
was considered the most revolting of eatables. Eat a crocodile, does not
mean a whole raw one, but such as the alligator mentioned in the shop of
Romeo's apothecary, probably preserved in spirits.</p>

<p>Here we have possibilities put against the rant of Laertes; <i>the doing</i>
against <i>the saying</i>; the quietude of the philosophic prince, against
the ranting of the robustious Laertes; things that <i>could be done</i>,&mdash;for
Hamlet ends with "I'll do it." That is, he will weep, fight, fast, tear
himself, drink bitterness, and eat monstrosities: and this is his
challenge of Laertes to the true testimony of his love, in contrast to
his wordy lamentation. But his quick imagination has caught an impetus
from its own motion, and he goes on, "Nay, I will even outprate you;"
and then follows his superior rant, not uttered with sincere vehemence,
but with quiet and philosophic scorn; and he ends with the reproof of
Laertes' mouthing; a thing particularly distasteful to him. And now, in
accordance with this dignified contempt is his final remonstrance and
his exit speech of&mdash;</p>


    <div class="poem">
 <p> "I lov'd you ever; but it is no matter;</p>
      <p>Let Hercules himself," &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<p>We thus see that there is no real rant in Hamlet; he is not outbragging
Laertes; but institutes the possible, in contradiction to swagger and
mouthing. The interpretation of <i>eisell</i> thus becomes a matter of
character, and to a great degree would determine an actor's mode of
rendering the whole scene. This result I do not see that any of your
correspondents have taken notice of; and yet it really is the main thing
worth discussing.</p>

<p>This interpretation too has the advantage of coinciding with
Shakspeare's perpetual love of contrast; the hot, hasty, wordy Laertes
being in strong contrast to the philosophic, meditating, and melancholy
young prince; always true to his character, and ever the first in every
scene by his own calm dignity. He never rants at all, but rides over his
antagonist by his cool reasoning and his own magnificent imagination.
The adoption of Theobald and Hickson's interpretation of the word
<i>eisell</i> becomes therefore of great importance as indicating the
character of Hamlet.</p>


<p class="right"> F. G. T.</p>


<p>Many of your readers no doubt feel much indebted to your correspondent
for his able summary of the <i>eisell</i> controversy; an example which it is
to be hoped will be followed in other cases. It has induced me to
collect a few passages for the purpose of showing that Shakspeare was
accustomed to make use of what may be termed <i>localisms</i>, which were
frequently as occult as in the instance of the <i>eisell</i>; and that he was
especially fond of establishing himself with the children of his brain
in the particular country by means of allusion to the neighbouring seas
and rivers. What appropriate signs are the Centaur and the Ph&oelig;nix for
the city of Ephesus, the scene of the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>! The Italian,
Iachimo, speaks of&mdash;</p>


    <div class="poem">
 <p> "&mdash;&mdash; lips as common as the stairs</p>
     <p> That mount the capitol."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Petruchio alludes to the bursting of "a chestnut in a farmer's
fire," an incident probably of common occurrence in the sunny south. In
<i>Hamlet</i>, with which we are chiefly concerned, the king "gulps his
draughts of <i>Rhenish</i> down;" and the grave-digger talks of a flagon of
<i>Rhenish</i> having been poured by the jester upon his head, the wine with
which Denmark would naturally be supplied. His majesty inquires:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <p>    "Where are the <i>Switzers</i>? let them guard the door."</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the student Horatio is judiciously placed at the university of
Wittenburg. Constant mention is made in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> of the
Rialto; and Portia, not unmindful of the remarkable position of the
city, thus directs Balthazar:</p>

   <div class="poem">
 <p> "Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin'd speed</p>
     <p> Unto the tranect, to the common ferry</p>
      <p>Which trades to Venice."</p>
</div>

<p>What a fine Hebraism (Hazlitt remarks) is that of Shylock, where he
declares, that he would not have given his ring "for a whole wilderness
of monkeys!" And so, if the subjoined passage in <i>Othello</i> relates to
the ceremony of the Doge's union with the sea, may we not exclaim "What
an admirable Venetianism!"</p>

  <div class="poem">
  <p> "I would not my unhoused free condition</p>
     <p> Put into circumscription and confine</p>
      <p>For the sea's worth."</p>
</div>

<p>The Moor has not travelled far to find the following simile:</p>


          <div class="poem">
   <p class="i5"> "Like to the Pontick sea,</p>
      <p>Whose icy current and compulsive course</p>
      <p>Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</p>
      <p>To the Propontick and the Hellespont."</p></div>


<p>Petruchio asserts in respect to Catherine:</p>

            <div class="poem">
 <p class="i5">"&mdash;&mdash; Were she as rough</p>
      <p>As are the swelling Adriatic waves,</p>
     <p> I come to wive it wealthily in Padua."</p>
</div>

<p>In the Roman plays the Tiber is repeatedly noticed. The Thames occurs in
<i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, and others. And in the Egyptian scenes of
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, the Nile is several times introduced.</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "Master Brook [says Falstaff], I will be thrown into Etna, as I
   have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus."</p>


<p>Antony exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem">
   <p>   "Let Rome in Tiber melt!"</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">while Cleopatra gives utterance to the same sentiment:</p>

    <div class="poem">
 <p>"Melt Egypt into Nile! And kindly creatures</p>
     <p> Turn all to serpents!"</p>
</div>

<p>In the last two passages it may be observed, that the hyperbolical
treatment of the two rivers
<a id="rivers157"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[157]</span>
 bears some analogy to that of the
<i>eisell</i>; and it may also be pointed out, that although one of your
correspondents has rashly maintained that the word cannot mean a river
because the definite article is omitted before it, Thames, Tiber, and
Nile here occur without. Upon the whole it must appear that there is
some reason for adopting the motto:</p>

    <div class="poem">
 <p> "Flow on, thou shining river."</p>
</div>

   <p class="right"> T.</p>

<p><i>Eisell</i> will, I think, if examples from our old writers decide, be at
least acknowledged to mean in Shakspeare what we now (improperly?) call
vinegar, and not any river. In <i>The Goolden Letanye of the Lyf and
Passion of our Lorde Jesu Criste</i>, edited from a MS. (No. 546.) in the
library at Lambeth, by Mr. Maskell, <i>Monumenta Ritualia</i>, ii. 252.,
comes this entreaty:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "For thi thirste and tastyng of gall and <i>eysyl</i>, graunte us to
   tast the swetnes of thi spirite; and have mercy on us."</p>

<p>All through the sixteenth century, and ages before, <i>eisell</i> was not
only a housewife's word, but in every one's mouth&mdash;in the poet's as he
sang, the preacher's as he preached, and the people's while they prayed.
Surely, for this very reason, if Shakspeare meant Hamlet to rant about a
river, the bard would never have made the king choose, before all
others, that very one which bore the same name with the then commonest
word in our tongue: a tiny stream, moreover, which, if hardly ever
spoken of in these days of geographical knowledge, must have been much
less known then to Englishmen.</p>

<p>Your correspondent J. S. W. well deserves the thanks of all those of
your readers who have taken an interest in the discussion on the meaning
of <i>eisell</i> in <i>Hamlet</i>, for the able manner in which he has summed up
the evidence put forward by the counsel on both sides. Perhaps he is
correct in his conclusion, that, of twelve good men and true, nine would
give their verdict for <i>eisell</i> being "a river;" while but three would
favour the "bitter potion." Nevertheless, I must say, I think the
balance yet hangs pretty even, and I rather incline myself to the latter
opinion, for these reasons:</p>

<p>1. There is no objection whatever, even in the judgment of its enemies,
against <i>eisell</i> meaning "a bitter potion," except that they <i>prefer</i>
the river as more to their taste; for the objection of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">AUSTON</span> I
conceive to have no weight at all, that "to drink up" can only be
applied "to a definite quantity;" surely it may also mean, and very
naturally, to drink "without stint." And <i>eisell</i> need not be taken as
meaning nothing more than "vinegar;" it may be a potion or medicament of
extreme bitterness, as in the 111th sonnet, and in Lydgate's <i>Troy Boke</i>
quoted by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>, such, that while it would be possible to sip or
drink it in small quantities, or diluted, yet to swallow a quantity at a
draught would be almost beyond endurance; and hence, I submit, the
appropriateness of "drink up."</p>

<p>2. There is this objection against <i>eisell</i> meaning a river,&mdash;Would the
poet who took a world-wide illustration from <i>Ossa</i>, refer in the same
passage to an obscure local river for another illustration? Moreover it
does not appear to be sufficient to find any mere river, whose name
resembles the word in question, without showing also that there is a
propriety in Hamlet's alluding, to that particular river, either on
account of its volume of water, its rapid flow, &amp;c., or from its being
in sight at the time he spoke, or near at hand.</p>

<p>Can any of your readers, who have Shakspeare more at their fingers' ends
than myself, instance any <i>exact parallel</i> of this allusion of his to
<i>local</i> scenery, which, being necessarily obscure, must more or less mar
the universality, if I may so speak, of his dramas. Could such instances
be pointed out (which I do not deny) or at least any one exactly
parallel instance, it would go far towards reconciling myself at least
to the notion that <i>eisell</i> is the river Essel.</p>

<h3><span>LORD MAYOR NOT A PRIVY COUNCILLOR.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 9. 137.)</span></h3>

<p>I will not attempt to follow all the statements of L. M., because some
of them are totally beside the question, and others contradict each
other. I shall only observe that he totally mistakes <i>my</i> argument when
he says, as if in reply to me, that <i>it is not necessary to have the
courtesy title of lord to be a privy councillor</i>. No one ever said any
such thing. What I said was this, that the Mayor of London, like those
of Dublin and York, had the courtesy title of <i>lord</i>, and that this
title of <i>lord</i> brought with it the other courtesy designation of <i>right
honorable</i>, which latter being <i>also</i> (but not <i>likewise</i>) the
designation of privy councillors, had, as I suppose, occasioned the
error now predicated of the Mayor of London being a privy councillor,
which, I repeat, he is no more than any Lord John or Lady Jane, who have
also the title of Right Honorable.</p>

<p>L. M., however, states as a matter of fact, that "the Lord Mayor is
always <i>summoned to council</i> on the accession of a new sovereign." Now I
assert, and I think have proved in my former note, that the Lord Mayor
never was so <i>summoned to council</i>. I now add that he never has on any
occasion entered the <i>council chamber</i>, that he has never taken the oath
nor performed any act of a privy councillor, and that in short there is
not the
<a id="not158"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[158]</span>
 smallest doubt with any one who knows anything about the
Privy Council, that the <i>Lord Mayor of London</i> no more belongs to it
than the <i>Lord Mayors of York or Dublin</i>, or the <i>Lord Provost of
Edinburgh</i>, all of whom are equally styled Right Honorable, which title,
I repeat, is the sole and silly pretence of this new-fangled hypothesis.</p>

<h3><span>"HOUSE OF YVERY."<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 101. 136.)</span></h3>

<p>Observing the imperfect knowledge which Lowndes and your correspondents
apparently have of the work called Anderson's <i>House of Yvery</i>, I send
you a few Notes to clear up some points.</p>

<p>It may be said there were two editions of this work; one containing the
censorious comments of (I presume) Lord Egmont on the degraded state of
the peerage; the second, that in which those comments were cancelled. To
the first, no printer's name appeared in the title-page; to the second
is the name of "H. Woodfall, jun."</p>

<p>Lowndes has entirely mistaken the origin of the different paging in vol.
i. The fact is, the original edition of the Introduction contained 41
pages of text, but the cancels reduced that number to 37; which p. 37.,
as Lowndes correctly remarks, is in the second edition misprinted 29. I
possess both copies, with and without the cancels. By Lowndes we are led
to believe that only p. xxxvii. was destroyed; but in truth they are p.
xvi., and parts of pp. xv. and xvii., and nearly the whole of pp.
xxxv.-vi., containing the anecdotes of the tailor's son and the
apothecary's brother-in-law being sent, or intended to be sent, to
foreign courts, as ambassadors from England. Another cancel occurs in
vol. ii., of nearly the whole of pp. 444-5-6, which occasions Lowndes to
say that pp. 446-7 are missing. The duplicate pages 453 to 460 are
peculiar to the second edition only. One of my copies contains two
additional plates, one of Wardour Castle, the other of Acton Burnell,
evidently engraved for the work. The map of the baronies of Duhallow,
&amp;c., is only in one copy, viz. the original edition. Unfortunately, this
original edition wants all the portraits of Faber, but it has the tomb
of Richard Percival of 1190, beginning "Orate," as in Lowndes. It
contains also a duplicate portrait of Sir Philip Percival, engraved by
Toms in 1738 (who also engraved the Wardour and Acton Burnell Castles);
and this duplicate is also in the other copy.</p>

<p>Were I to form any judgment when this work was commenced, I should say
about 1738, and that all the engravings for it were done by Toms; and
the first edition was printed in 1742, without any printer's name, and
that some copies were so bound up. The other copies remained in sheets
until the next year, when Faber was employed to engrave the portraits,
and till 1744 or 1747; 1747 being the latest date of Faber's plates.
There is some curious information in these volumes, and I would
recommend your readers to observe how much the conduct of the Catholics
of Ireland, recorded in vol. ii. p. 271., resembles that of the
Catholics of the present day.</p>

<h3><span>ON "RACK" IN THE TEMPEST.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 37. 121.)</span></h3>

<p>I think A. E. B. has not understood M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ICKSON'S</span> argument in reference
to this word. Perhaps the latter may not have expressed himself very
clearly; and not having by me his original paper on the subject, I
cannot cite his exact words; but his argument I take to be to this
effect:&mdash;In construction of the passage there is a double comparison,
which, though perfectly clear to the intelligent reader, causes some
confusion when a doubt is first raised as to the meaning of the word,
and which can be cleared up only by a thorough analysis. "The
cloud-capp'd towers," &amp;c., are first compared with "the baseless fabric
of this vision," <i>like which</i> they "shall dissolve," and afterwards with
"this insubstantial pageant," <i>like which</i> (<i>having "faded"</i>) they shall
"leave not a rack behind." A given object can be said to "leave behind"
only that which was originally of its elements, and for this reason only
a general term such as <i>wreck</i> or <i>vestige</i> will accord with the
construction of the passage.</p>

<p>I am sorry to find that any one should misquote Shakspeare for the
purpose of obtaining a temporary triumph: probably, however, in the
instance I am about to cite, A. E. B. has really fallen into the common
error of regarding two similes as one. He says, giving the substance of
Shakspeare's passage, "the globe itself shall dissolve, and, like this
vision, leave not a wreck behind." What Shakspeare in substance <i>does</i>
say is, "The globe itself, <i>like this vision</i>, shall dissolve, and,
<i>like this faded pageant, shall</i> leave not a rack behind." A. E. B.'s
question, therefore, "in what was the resemblance to the vision to
consist, if not in melting, like it, into thin air?" is thus answered:
The resemblance <i>does</i> consist in <i>dissolving</i>, or "melting" away.</p>

<p>My object in making these remarks is not to express an opinion on one
side or the other, but to draw the attention of your readers to the real
question at issue. I therefore say nothing as to whether Shakspeare may
or may not have had a prevision of the nebular theory; though I cannot
see that this would be in the least affected by our decision as to the
meaning of this word, since the <i>wrack</i> or <i>wreck</i> of the world might
well be represented
<a id="represented159"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[159]</span>
 by the "vapour" for which A. E. B. contends.
As, however, this gentleman says such is its meaning "beyond all doubt,"
(a rather dogmatic way of settling the question, by the way, seeing that
a doubt had been thrown upon it in the very paper he has engaged himself
to answer,) I should like to be informed if there is any authority for
the use of the word in Shakspeare, or his cotemporaries, as <i>mere</i>
"haze" or "vapour." I have generally understood it to mean a
<i>particular</i> description of cloud, or, as some say, more properly, the
course of the clouds in motion.</p>

<p>In fine, as Prospero did undoubtedly point to the dissolution of the
globe and all that it contained, it is quite clear that it could in such
case leave neither "cloud" nor "vapour," nor anything else behind it.
The simple question then remains: Is the word <i>rack</i>, as elsewhere used
by Shakspeare and his contemporaries, logically applicable there?</p>

   masses of the clouds sweep onward in swift <i>stream</i>."</p>


<p>On reading this, it struck me that the English word <i>rack</i> exactly
expresses the meaning of "der Wolken Zug."</p>

<p>Malone, in his note on the <i>Tempest</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1., says:</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "<i>Rack</i> is generally used for a <i>body of clouds</i>, or rather for

<h3><span>RICHARD ROLLE OF HAMPOLE.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 49. 116.)</span></h3>

<p>The productions of the writer known by the name of the Hermit of Hampole
have been hitherto much neglected: they afford copious illustrations of
ancient manners, and are very valuable in a philological point of view.
I would especially name the <i>Speculum Vitæ, or Mirrour of Life</i>, of
which I possess two MSS. in entirely distinct dialects.</p>

<p>Your Cambridge correspondent has shown that the Metrical Sermons contain
interesting passages also illustrative of manners and as the extracts he
has made have given occasion to some glossarial Queries from an Oxford
correspondent, J. E., should they not be more satisfactorily answered by
C. H., to whom they are addressed, perhaps the following attempt to
resolve them may not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>1. By the <i>devenisch</i> most probably the <i>Danish</i> is meant, which we find
elsewhere written <i>Deniske</i>, <i>Daniske</i>, and <i>Danske</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Guystroun</i> should be <i>quystroun</i>, which is used by Chaucer in the
<i>Romaunt of the Rose</i>, and signifies a <i>scullion</i>, as is evident from
this passage. It is from the O. Fr. <i>quistron</i> or <i>cuistron</i>. Thus in K.
Alisaunder (Weber's <i>Metr. Rom.</i>), v. 2511.:</p>

<div class="poem">
     <p> "Ther n'as knave no <i>quistron</i></p>
     <p> That he no hadde gôd waryson."</p>
</div>

<p>3. By <i>Chaunsemlees</i> we may probably understand <i>schoon-semeles</i>,
signifying, no doubt, <i>sandals</i>.</p>

<p>4. "Hir chere was ay <i>semand</i> sori," which your correspondent says is
"an expression very strange to English verse," is nothing more than the
old form of <i>seeming</i>: her cheer was ever sorrowful or <i>sad-seeming</i>.
The termination <i>and</i> or <i>ande</i>, as well as <i>inde</i>, was formerly used
where we now have <i>ing</i>. Examples are numerous of this form; as <i>semand</i>
and <i>semynd</i>, <i>spekand</i>, <i>strikinde</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Gawin Douglas, <i>Eneados</i>, we have <i>glaidsembland</i> for an appearance
of joy or gladness, a <i>cheerful countenance</i>; and in b. ii. v. 159.:</p>

and the following plural form I do not recollect to have observed

<h4><span><i>Was Stella Swift's Sister?</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 450.; Vol. iv., p.
110.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;That Swift was the son of Sir William Temple seems to have been
completely disproved by Mason. Swift was born in Dublin, 30th November,
1667, in the house of his uncle Godwin Swift, who, after the death of
his younger brother, Jonathan, in the preceding April, took charge of
his widow. Sir William Temple appears from his letters to have been
abroad in a public capacity from 1665 to 1670. If therefore, there
existed such consanguinity between Swift and Stella as to be a bar to
their marriage, it must have arisen in some other way. Swift says that
Stella "was born at Richmond in Surrey, on 13th March, 1681; her father
being the younger brother of a good family in Nottinghamshire [Qy. Sir
Wm. Temple? Sheen, where he resided, was close by], her mother of a
lower degree." There can be little doubt that she was illegitimate. The
question arises, who was her mother? On this point the Richmond registry
might perhaps throw some light. <i>Has it ever been searched?</i> In order
that the supposed consanguinity should have existed, her mother must
have been either Swift's mother, Abigail Swift (<i>née</i> Erick) of
Leicestershire, or (what seems more probable) an illegitimate
half-sister of Swift. It has been surmised, however, that an impediment
to Swift's marriage of an entirely different nature from consanguinity
may have existed; or that, feeling himself to be labouring under an
hereditary disease, he may have been unwilling to propagate it. I am
much inclined to think that the objection to the marriage of Swift and
Stella, which certainly must have existed, was of this last description;
and that
<a id="that161"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[161]</span>
it would have been equally strong the case of any other
female. However this may be, I believe that full credit may be given to
what Swift has stated respecting the perfect purity of his intercourse
with Stella.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"I knew her from six years old, and had some share in her
   education, by directing what books she should read, and
   perpetually instructing her in the principles of honour and
   virtue, from which she never swerved in any one action or moment
   of her life."&mdash;Swift's <i>Works</i>, vol ix. p. 489. (<i>citante</i>

Justice Talfourd was the author of this epitaph. The observation,
however, was made without, I believe, any <i>certain</i> knowledge on the

<h4><span><i>Meaning of Carnaby</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 495.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;A<span class="smcap lowercase">RUN</span> inquires as to the
meaning of Carnaby as the name of a street. Carnaby is a surname
probably deriving from the parish of Carnaby in Yorkshire. It has become
a Christian name in the family of &mdash;&mdash; Haggerston, Bart., since the
marriage of an heiress of Carnaby's into that family.</p>

<h4><span><i>Scandinavian Mythology</i></span> <span>(Vol. ii, p. 141.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent T. J.
has called attention to the tradition-falsifying assertion of Mr. G.
Pigott, that the custom with which the Scandinavians were long
reproached, of drinking out of the skulls of their enemies, has no other
foundation than a blunder of Olaus Wormius in translating a passage in
the death-song of Regner Lodbrog.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the curious and learned work of Bartholinus,
<i>De Causis Contemptæ a Danis Adhuc Gentilibus Mortis</i>, will, I think,
show that the subject deserves further inquiry before we consent to
place this ancient historical tradition in the category of vulgar
errors. Speaking of the banquets of the beatified heroes in Valhalla,
Bartholinus says:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Neque tamen ex communi animalium cornu elaborata pocula in
   Valhalla viserentur; sacratiora desiderabantur ex cæsorum craniis
   inimicorum confecta, quæ apud Danos vel ex Daniâ oriundos, alias
   quoque gentes, in summo erant pretio."&mdash;Lib. ii. cap. xii. p.
   555.</p>

<p>In proof of this assertion he quotes the following authors; Herodotus
(lib. iv. cap. 65.) and Plato (Euthydemus), who attribute this custom to
the Scythians. Aristotle is supposed to allude to it, <i>De Repub.</i> lib.
vii. cap. 2. In the <i>Historia Miscellanea</i>, lib. vi., it is mentioned as
a custom of the Scordisci; and similar customs are recorded of the
Panebi by Nicolaus Damascenus, of the Essedones by Solinus and Mela, of
the Boii by Livy (lib iii. cap. 24.), of the Celts by Silius Italicus
(lib. ii.), of the Langobards by Paulus Diaconus (lib. i. cap. 27.). The
last-mentioned author informs us that these skull cups were alled
"scalæ;" upon which Bartholinus remarks&mdash;</p>


  <p class="blockquot"> "Unde genus, undeque morem ejusmodi conficiendarum paterarum unde
   etiam nomen <i>scalæ</i> iis inditum, ex septentrione nempe traxerunt
   Langobardi manifestum facient Vaulundar qvidu.</p>

<h4><span><i>Scandal against Queen Elizabeth</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., pp. 225. 285. 393.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I do
not recollect that either of your correspondents on this subject has
brought forward the aspersion upon Queen Elizabeth's fair fame in
precisely the same form in which the Jesuit Sanders places it in the
following passage:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Hâc Ecclesiæ contra ipsam sententiâ, et Catholicorum novis
   incrementis quotidianis, non mediocriter offensa Elizabetha,
   convocatis ordinibus, leges valde iracundas et cruentas contra
   veteris fidei cultores promulgat: quibus primum cavetur, <i>ne quis
   Elizabetham hæreticam, schismaticam, infidelem, usurpatricemve,
   sub p&oelig;nâ capitis vocet</i>. Item. <i>Ne quis aliam quamcunque
   certam personam nominet, cui regnum vel in vitâ, vel post mortem
   ipsius, deberi dicatur, exceptâ Elizabethæ naturali prole.</i> Ea
   enim sunt ipsa decreti verba. In eam enim homines vel adulationem
   vel necessitatem ita perduxit hæresis, ut quod illud nobilissimum
   regnum illegitimæ illius regis sui proli ægre unquam concessit,
   nunc <i>naturali</i>, id est, <i>spuriæ</i>, soboli reginæ in cujus sexu
   fornicationis peccatum est f&oelig;dius, non denegarint: pariter et
   reipublicæ, ex proximi successoris ignoratione, extremum
   periculum, et Elizabethæ incontinentiam prodentes."&mdash;Nicolai
   Sanderi <i>Hist. Schism. Angl.</i> lib. iii. § Novæ leges latæ in
   Catholicos, ann. 1571, ed. 8vo. Col. Agr. 1628, p. 299.</p>


<p>To some of your readers this passage may seem to indicate that the use
of the equivocal word <i>naturali</i> may have given colour, not to say
occasion, to the whole scandal against Queen Elizabeth. By many, I
apprehend, it will be acknowledged that <i>spuriæ</i> is not the only, if an
allowable, interpretation.</p>

<h4><span><i>Meaning of "Deal"</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 88.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I think the following may help
to throw a little light upon the use of the word <i>deal</i> as meaning
<i>divide</i>. I was in Wensleydale about a month ago; and on inquiring where
the boundary between the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire ran, was
told, "On the top of Penhill, where God's water deals" (<i>i. e.</i> the rain
divides). I may further add, on my own knowledge, that in the north-west
corner of Suffolk, where the country is almost entirely open,
<a id="open162"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[162]</span>
the boundaries of the different parishes are marked by earthen mounds,
from three to six feet high, which are known in the neighbourhood as
<i>dools</i> the word being probably derived from the same root. I have been
told, however, that it should be spelled <i>duals</i>, and that the
derivation of it was from the Latin <i>duo</i> as marking two parishes; but I
am sure that it is always pronounced by the country-people at a
monosyllable, and therefore the chances are in favour of the former
derivation being the right one.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> to Suffolk, another of your correspondents (Vol. iv., p. 55)
lately mentioned the fashion the people there have of leaving out the
<i>ve</i> in the middle of the names of places. In this I can bear him
witness also; but I do not think it is confined to those letters only:
<i>e. g.</i> Eriswell, pronounced <i>Asel</i>; Wymondham (in Norfolk) <i>Wyndham</i>,
&amp;c. Among those names of places in which the <i>ve</i> is left out, your
correspondent has omitted Elved<i>e</i>n (commonly, though erroneously,
Elved<i>o</i>n), which is always called and often spelled <i>Elden</i>.</p>

 <p class="right"> A. N.</p>




<h4><span><i>"The Worm in the Bud," &amp;c.</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 86.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;This quotation is from
Cowper's lines appended to the Bill of Mortality for the parish of All
Saints, Northampton, for 1787:</p>

     <div class="poem">
<p> "Read, ye that run, the awful truth</p>
        <p class="i3">With which I charge my page;</p>
      <p>A worm is in the bud of youth,</p>
        <p class="i3">And at the root of age."</p>
</div>

<p>I know not with whom the idea originated. The imagery is frequently used
by Shakspeare, but with him never indicates disease or death.</p>

<p>I can call to mind no similar expression in the classics.</p>

<h4><span><i>Moore's Almanack</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 74.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent F<span class="smcap lowercase">RANCIS</span> is in
error as to the MSS. and correspondence of Henry Andrews being in the
possession of his son, Mr. Wm. Henry Andrews. Mr. W. H. Andrews some
time ago sold to me the whole of his father's MSS. correspondence,
astronomical and astrological calculations, with a mass of very curious
letters from persons desirous of having their "nativities cast." I have
also some copies of Andrews' portrait, one of which shall be much at
your service.</p>

<p>Moore's <i>Almanack</i> was known by that name long before Andrews had any
connection with it, but he was for upwards of forty years its compiler
for the Company of Stationers, whose liberal (?) treatment of Andrews
may be collected from the following postscript to a letter addressed to
me by his son:&mdash;</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"My father's calculations, &amp;c., for Moore's <i>Almanack</i>, continued
   during a period of forty-three years; and although through his
   great talent and management he increased the sale of that work
   from 100,000 to 500,000, yet, strange to say, all he received for
   his services was 25<i>l.</i> per ann.!! Yet I never heard him murmur
   even once about it; such was his delight in pursuing his
   favourite studies, that his anxiety about remuneration was out of
   the question. Sir Richard Phillips, who at times visited him at
   Royston, once met him in London, and endeavoured to persuade him
   to go with him to Stationers' Hall, and he would get him 100<i>l.</i>;
   but he declined going, saying that he was satisfied."</p>


<p>Andrews was also computer to the Board of Longitude, and Maskelyne's
<i>Letters</i> evidence the value and correctness of his calculations.</p>

<p>The only materials left by Andrews for a memoir of his life I believe I
possess, and some day I may find leisure to put them into order for
publication.</p>

<h4><span><i>Scurvy Ale.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The Query (Vol. iv., p. 68.) "What was scurvy ale?" may
perhaps be answered by an extract from a little work, <i>The Polar Sea and
Regions</i>, published by Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh. In the account of
Baffin's voyage, in which he discovered the bay called after him
Baffin's Bay, we are told that&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Finding the health of his crew rather declining, he sailed
   across to Greenland, where an abundance of <i>scurvy grass boiled
   in beer</i> quickly restored them; and the Lord then sent them a
   speedy and good passage homeward."</p>

<p>about which MR. M<span class="smcap lowercase">C</span>C<span class="smcap lowercase">ABE</span> asks, is a very old custom in England. Matt. Paris, in his
description of Abbot William's funeral at St. Albans, A.D. 1235, tells
us how&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Corpus apertum est. &amp;c. Et quicquid in corpore repertum est, in
   quadam cuna repositum est, sale conspersum. Et in c&oelig;miterio,
   est humatum. Corpus autem interius, aceto lotum et imbutum et
   multo sale respersum et resutum. Et hoc sic factum est
   circumspecte et prudenter, ne corpus per triduum et amplius
   reservandum, tetrum aliquem odorem olfacientibus generaret et
   corpus tumulandum, contrectantibus aliquod offendiculum

 <p class="left">Buckland, July 24. 1851.</p>


<p>In the 86th and two following sections of the Second Book of Herodotus
is the description of the ancient Egyptian methods of preserving
the
<a id="the163"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[163]</span>
 bodies of the dead. These were more or less embalmed with
aromatic spices, according to the condition of the person, and then
corned with saltpetre (<span title="[Greek: litron]">&#955;&#953;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>nitre</i>) for seventy days;
strictly, <i>salted</i>. Is it possible that the early Christians, in
adopting this practice, may have been influenced by that very obscure
passage, Mark ix. 49.: "Every one shall be <i>salted</i> with fire?"</p>

<p class="right"> A<span class="smcap lowercase">LFRED</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span>.</p>


<p>The custom of placing a plate of salt on the body of the dead is very
general in Wales. I remember, when a child, inquiring the reason of the
practice, and being told by an old woman that it was to prevent the body
from swelling. My remark, that <i>any</i> weight might answer the same
purpose, was met by the reply; "there's no weight so heavy as salt gets
when it is on the dead." This proves that some feeling of superstition
mingles with the custom. Has not the use of salt in baptism, amongst the
Italians &amp;c., come allusion to the banishment of the evil spirit?</p>

<h4><span><i>The Word "Repudiate"</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 54.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;That the use of the word
<i>repudiate</i>, in the sense of refuse, repel, reject, abandon, disown,
cast off, is by no means modern; and that such phrases as "I repudiate
the idea," "I repudiate the sentiment," "I repudiate the proposal," are
strictly correct, is evident from the use of the word by "standard
classical authors" in the original language from which it has come down
to us. Sallust, for instance, in his <i>History of Catiline's Conspiracy</i>,
says that Lentulus advised him to seek assistance everywhere, even
amongst the dregs of the populace; asking him at the same time, "Why,
since the senate had already adjudged him to be an enemy to the
republic, he should <i>repudiate the slaves</i>?" i. e., refuse to enrol them
in his levies.</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"Cum ab senatu hostis judicatus sit, quo consilio <i>servitia
   repudiet</i>?"&mdash;<i>Sall. Cat.</i> 44.</p>


<p>Cicero, in his Offices, in opposition to the opinion of the peripatetic
school, that anger is implanted in us by nature for useful ends, lays it
down as a principle, that "on all occasions <i>anger ought to be
repudiated</i>;" that is, "cast out of the mind," and says that "it is to
be wished that persons who are at the head of the state should be like
the laws, which inflict punishment not in anger but in justice."</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "<i>Illa</i> (iracundia) vero omnibus in rebus <i>repudianda
   est</i>."&mdash;<i>Cic. de Off.</i> I. xxv. 13.</p>


<p>Cicero knew nothing of the Christian grace of "being angry and sinning,
not;" he knew nothing of the severity of love. In another place he tells
us that on one occasion Themistocles declared in the Athenian assembly,
that he had a plan to propose which would be of great advantage to the
state, but ought not to be made public. He was willing, however, to
communicate it to any one person whom they might select. Aristides,
rightly named the Just, being the person selected, Themistocles
disclosed his plan to him: which was, secretly to set fire to the
Lacedæmonian fleet in the dockyard of Gytheum, by which means they would
effectually crush the power of the Lacedæmonians. Aristides returned to
the assembly, and at once declared that Themistocles' plan was certainly
very advantageous, but by no means honourable; whereupon the Athenians,
rightly considering that what was not attended with honour, could not be
attended even with advantage in reality, without hearing another word,
"<i>repudiated the whole affair</i>;" that is, utterly rejected the proposal.</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"Itaque Athenienses, quod honestum non esset, id ne utile quidem
   putaverunt; <i>totamque eam rem</i>, quam ne audierant quidem, auctore
   Aristide, <i>repudiaverunt</i>."&mdash;<i>Cic. de Off.</i> III. xi. 12.</p>


<p>In a third place, he relates that some persons forged a will of one
Minucius Basilus, who had died in Greece; and, in order that they might
the more easily obtain their end, put down Marcus Crassus and Quintus
Hortensius, two of the most influential men in Rome at that time, as
co-legatees with themselves, who although they suspected the will to be
forged, yet did not <i>repudiate the little legacy</i> coming to them through
other persons' fraud, because forsooth they were not privy to the actual
commission of the forgery.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Qui cum illud falsum esse suspicarentur, sibi autem nullius
   essent conscii culpæ, alieni facinoris <i>munusculum non
   repudiaverunt</i>."&mdash;<i>Cic. de Off.</i> III. xviii. 4.</p>


<p>A little further research might easily multiply instances, but I think
these are quite sufficient to prove that we moderns are but following
the ancients in using the word <i>repudiate</i> without reference to any
<i>obligation</i> expressed or implied.</p>

<h4><span><i>Repudiate, Ringlet, Outburst</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 54.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent
H. C. K. has dealt, I fear, somewhat too harshly with "repudiate."
Surely "repudiare" is "to reject what one is ashamed of, scorns, or
disdains." Two instances immediately suggest themselves in <i>Cicer. pro
Plancio</i>, 18 (44). 20 (50). In the former&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Respuerent aures, nemo agnosceret, repudiarent,"</p>


<p class="noindent">perhaps the word is a gloss upon "respuerunt." The latter, however, is
unexceptionable:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Nunquam enim fere nobilitas, integra præsertim atque innocens, a
   Populo Romano supplex repudiata fuit."</p>


<p class="noindent">Why then should "repudiate" necessarily imply the notion of
"obligation?" and why should I, if I "repudiate" the criticism of H. C.
K., be held to "talk nonsense?"</p>

<p>May I be allowed room for a couple of Queries? 1. Is our modern usage of
"ringlet" found before
<a id="before164"></a>
 <span  class="pagenum">[164]</span>
 the time of Milton? 2. What is the
earliest authority for "outburst?"</p>

<h4><span><i>On the Letter "v"</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 55.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I have read with pleasure the
paragraphs in your "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" on "the letter <i>v</i>," and beg
space for a further notice, with an especial reference to the patronymic
of <i>Ray</i> or <i>Wray</i>. One family uses the motto, "Juste et <i>V</i>rai," whose
name is <i>Wray</i>; and another the same motto, whose name is <i>Ray</i>. And it
will be remembered that John Ray, the naturalist, changed the
orthography of his name from <i>Wray</i> to <i>Ray</i>, as he concluded it had
been formerly written; and in one of the letters published by the Ray
Society,
<a id="Society9"></a><a title="Go to footnote 9." href="#fn9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
 allusion is made to the adjective or substantive <i>vrai</i>, as
if that distinguished philosopher and divine had either derived his name
thence, or it had the same signification as that French word. Are we
then to take this as an instance of the silent <i>v</i> or <i>double u</i> or <i>v</i>;
and as any proof that families writing their names <i>Wray</i> and <i>Ray</i> were
originally of one patronymic and one common root, and that presumptively
Norman?</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn9"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Society9" class="label">[9]</a> Vide the <i>Correspondence of John Ray</i>. Edited by Edwin
Lankester, M.D. London, 1848, pp. 65, 66.</p>

<p>Under a separate heading, perhaps you will also indulge me with a Query
as to the coat of arms, under the portrait by Bathon, 1760, after W.
Hibbart, of Joannes Rajus, A.M., prefixed to Dr. Derham's <i>Life of John
Ray</i>, published by George Scott, M.A. and F.R.S.: London, 1760. The
shield is, gules, on a fesse, between three crescents, three cross
crosslets. Is it inferable that that coat was ever borne by patent or
admissible prescriptive right, by any of his ancestors? Several families
in the north of England, whence his father came, also have registered in
respectable armories crescents against their names. The poor origin of
John Ray is obviated, in some degree, by what is said in a Life of him,
published in <i>The Portrait Gallery of British Worthies</i>, by Charles
Knight. I suppose he himself used the armorials in question, and was
related to the family of nearly the same name, bearing crescents, viz.
Reay.</p>

<h4><span><i>"Whig" and "Tory"</i> </span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 57.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The name "Whig" is derived from
the Celtic <i>ugham</i>, a sort of large saddle, with bags attached to it, in
use among the freebooters of the borders of Scotland: hence those
robbers were known to the Highlanders by the name of <i>Whiggam-more</i>, or
"big-saddle thieves;" and when the Civil War broke out, the Highlanders
and Irish, who supported the king, called themselves <i>a taobh Righ</i>, <i>i.
e.</i> "the king's party," and gave the name of <i>Whiggamore thieves</i> to
their opponents. <i>Whiggammore</i> and <i>taobh Righ</i> soon became shortened to
<i>Whig</i> and <i>Tory</i>, and in aftertimes served to distinguish the
supporters of the rival houses of Hanover and Stuart. The modern
signification of the terms is different, <i>Whig</i> being taken to mean
"liberal," and <i>Tory</i> "exclusive."</p>

<h4><span><i>Planets of the Months</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 23.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I do not understand this
Query. What is meant by "planets for the months?" There are twelve
months, and in common parlance only seven planets. Nor do I see what is
meant by "precious stones symbolizing <i>those</i> planets." In heraldry, the
arms of sovereigns and royal personages are blazoned by the names of the
sun, moon, and planets, for colours, as those of noblemen are by
precious stones. If this is what is asked after, the following table

<h4><span><i>Baronets of Ireland</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 44.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The two following extracts
may throw some light upon the origin of the title of baronet. James I.
probably adopted this title, which he found to have been so long
existing in Ireland, for the new order of nobility he was about to
establish. And it should be remembered that the order of baronet was
instituted for the purpose of promoting the plantation of Ulster.</p>

<p>The names mentioned in the second extract are probably those of the
baronets whom Spenser mentions as being, in existence in his time. There
was, thirty years ago, a "Baron of Galtrim;" perhaps there is still.</p>

<h4><span><i>Plowden</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 58.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;From Burke's <i>Landed Gentry</i>, 1846, under
"Plowden of Plowden" (<span class="smcap lowercase"><span class="smcap lowercase">A.D</span>.</span> 1194), it would appear that Edmund was of
Wansted, Hampshire, and ancestor of the Plowdens of Lassam, Hants, and
that he "was styled in his will, July 29, 1655, Sir Edmund, lord earl
palatine, governor, and captain general, of the province of New Albion."
I would suggest to your Transatlantic readers the interest that would be
derived from a compilation of surnames in the United States; and in
cases where it can be ascertained, the date of introduction, position of
first immigrant, ancestry, and descendants. The names and subsequent
history of those families who remained loyal during the American
Revolution, are worthy of record; most of whom have, I believe,
prospered in the world since the confiscation of their property.</p>

<p>The names of the followers of William the Conqueror are often alluded
to; but the "comers over" at the conquest of Wales, Scotland, and
Ireland are but seldom thought of, though they lend to their
descendants' pedigree a degree of historical interest.</p>

me. It will suffice to note that a very sufficient one will be found in
Todd's edition of <i>Spenser</i> (1803) in vol. iii., at the close of canto

<h4><span><i>Bells in Churches</i></span> <span>(Vol. ii., p. 326.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In reply to the inquiry
whether there is still a law against the use of bells as a summons to
divine services, except in churches, which has not been answered, permit
me to quote the following sentences from a judgment of Lord Chief
Justice Campbell, as reported in the <i>Times</i> of August 14.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"First, with regard to the right of using bells at all. By the
   common law, churches of every denomination had a full right to
   use bells, and it was a vulgar error to suppose that there was
   any distinction at the present time in this respect. At the same
   time, those bells might undoubtedly be made use of in such a
   manner as to create a nuisance; and in that case a Protestant
   church and a Roman Catholic one were equally liable."</p>

<p>The case (Soltan <i>v.</i> De Weld) from the judgment in which the above
remarks are extracted was tried at the Croydon Assizes, and related to
the use of bells by a Romanist community in such a manner as was alleged
to be a nuisance.</p>

<p>The Tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer in Westminster Abbey is fast mouldering
into irretrievable decay. A sum on One Hundred pounds will effect a
perfect repair. The Committee have not thought it right to fix any limit
to the contribution; they themselves have opened the list with a
subscription from each of them of Five Shillings; but they will be ready
to receive any amount, more or less, which those who value poetry and
honour Chaucer may be kind enough to remit to them.</p>

<p>Subscriptions have been received from the Earls of Carlisle, Ellesmere,
and Shaftesbury, Viscounts Strangford and Mahon, Pres. Soc. Antiq., the
Lords Braybrooke and Londesborough, and many other noblemen and
gentlemen.</p>

<p>Subscriptions are received by all the members of the Committee, and at
the Union Bank, Pall Mall East. Post-office orders may be made payable
at the Charing Cross Office, to William Richard Drake, Esq., the
Treasurer, 46. Parliament Street, or William J. Thomas, Esq., Hon. Sec.,
25. Holy-well Street, Millbank.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
